# Noise Machine .NET

Made for both relaxation and tinkering, using the Avalonia UI.
Noise can be adjusted with a filter (coming soon, not implemented yet) of variable settings, like low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass. The tone is a sine wave that can be binaural beats, isochronic tones, or solfeggio frequencies.
Built for .NET 7 or higher.

# Available noise types
- White (kind of loud)
- Pink (loud)
- Perlin (very quiet)
- Brownian (moderately quiet)
# Available tone types
- Binaural beats (right ear = left ear + frequency)
- Isochronic tones (volume goes on and off at a rate of the set frequency)
- Solfeggio frequencies (tone is at the set frequency)
